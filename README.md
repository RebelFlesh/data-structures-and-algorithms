This Repo is DeltaV's 401 class' challenge. It is both a test of our problem solving skills along with our ability to work with others. Mix that in with a bit of whiteboarding practice and this is the final product. Each challenge will have its title as well as a description underneath of the exersise. Finally a photo of the whiteboard is added to that day before the next challenge header.

## Reverse an array
In this challenge we were asked to:
Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the provided array argument with elements in reversed order.

## Shift an array
In this challenge we were asked to:
Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

## Binary Search
In this challenge we were asked to:
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.
